    <h3>How to make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
        Add eggs; cook and stir until scrambled and dry, about 5 minutes. Remove
        from heat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium
        heat. Stir in onion, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir frequently until
        onions are nearly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add carrots; cook and
        stir until carrots are nearly tender but still crunchy, 7 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir cabbage and scallions into the skillet; add 1 teaspoon soy sauce.
        Sprinkle 2 tablespoons curry powder and 1 tablespoon chili powder over
        the vegetable mixture; stir until coated. Turn stove top temperature to
        low.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix eggs and paratha into the vegetable mixture. Stir in remaining soy
        sauce, curry powder, and chili powder; stir until coated. Cook until
        flavors combine, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
